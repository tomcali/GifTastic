# GifTastic

Homewook involves working with an API to provide video-shorts of interest to the user. 

## Overview
Utilities for sets are in the utilities directory under the javascript directory.

I continue to work with Bootstrap 4, which is currently in alpha release. Bootstrap itself requires jQuery. Relevant files are found in the bootstrap and js directories.

## Viewing the Websites

Would have deployed to gh-pages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (style.css after Bootstrap 4 css and Yeti Bootswatch)
- JavaScript (via Bootstrap 4) 
- Set data structures implemented via JavaScript objects
- Git/GitHub
- Bootstrap and Bootstrap components for responsive design
- jQuery for event handling and AJAX calls
- Public-domain API access to video-shorts

## Code Explanation

- We start with GitHub, setting up the GifTastic repostory. We set up directories and subdirectories according to the assignment definitions. And we added bootstap as a directory, using much the same structure as in previous assignments. The javascript directory includes my JavaScript code. The images directory can contain images, but these are not essential for the game logic itself. A separate js directory was set up for the jQuery code. A separate bootstrap directory accommodates the bootstrap css and js files, as well as the Yeti css theme. (Because I like to be able to continue working when I have no connection to the Internet, I include copies of files in the repositories. Both human-readable and minified versions of JQuery were included because I am learning jQuery, and would like to inspect code for functions/methods on occasion.) 
- Set up the structure a la bootstrap.
- Set up method for adding buttons.
